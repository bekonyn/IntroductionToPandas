# IntroductionToPandas
Sharing my notes/comments about Python Pandas Library.

Im creating these series for people that have beginner/intermediate knowledge about pandas library.I m going to share my working notes(after tidying) to pass the info, nothing more. Certain codeblocks could get repetitive. Some info looks contradictory even though i have tried to remove most of them. Sorry for it beforehand. Also goodluck on your learning journey. This is my first kernel as well. Wish me luck. Contact me for any question, i will help you out as far as i can. Take care.
